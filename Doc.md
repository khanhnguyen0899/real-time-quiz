Component Description
Client Application (Frontend)
    Role: Interface for users to join quizzes, answer questions, and view the leaderboard.
    Technologies: React.js for building the user interface, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and Redux for state management.
Quiz Server (Backend)
    Role: Manages quiz sessions, processes answers, updates scores, and maintains the leaderboard.
    Technologies: Node.js with Express.js for handling HTTP requests, Socket.IO for real-time updates, and Redis for fast in-memory data storage.
    Database
Role: Stores user data, quiz questions, and historical scores.
Technologies: MongoDB for flexible document storage and Redis for caching real-time data.
External Services
    Role: Optional services for additional functionalities like authentication, analytics, and notifications.
    Technologies: Firebase Authentication for user management, Google Analytics for tracking user interactions, and Twilio for sending notifications.
    Data Flow
User Joins Quiz
    The user enters a unique quiz ID on the client application.
    The client sends a request to the Quiz Server to join the session.
    The Quiz Server verifies the quiz ID and adds the user to the session, updating the Redis cache.
Answer Submission
    Users submit their answers through the client application.
    The client sends the answer to the Quiz Server via Socket.IO.
    The Quiz Server processes the answer, updates the user's score in Redis, and broadcasts the updated score to all clients in the session.
Leaderboard Update
    The Quiz Server maintains the leaderboard in Redis.
    As scores are updated, the server broadcasts the updated leaderboard to all connected clients in real-time.
    The client application receives the updated leaderboard and re-renders it.

Scalability
    Horizontal Scaling: The backend server can be scaled by running multiple instances behind a load balancer.
    Database Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding to distribute data across multiple servers.
    WebSocket Efficiency: Socket.IO maintains persistent WebSocket connections to reduce overhead.
Performance
    Efficient Data Handling: MongoDB provides high performance for handling large data volumes.
    Asynchronous Processing: Node.js's asynchronous nature allows handling multiple requests concurrently.
    Optimization: Implementing caching mechanisms can further optimize performance.
Reliability
    Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling ensures the system can recover from failures.
    Redundancy: Multiple instances of the server and database improve reliability.
    Graceful Degradation: The system is designed to degrade gracefully in case of partial failures.
Maintainability
    Modular Code Structure: The code is organized into modules, making it easier to understand and maintain.
    Documentation: Comprehensive documentation helps other developers quickly understand the system.
    Code Reviews: Regular code reviews ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
Monitoring and Observability
    Logging: Comprehensive logging captures important events and errors.
    Metrics: Key performance metrics are collected and monitored using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
    Alerts: Automated alerts notify the development team of critical issues.
